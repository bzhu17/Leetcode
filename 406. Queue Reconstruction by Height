// Description:a pair of integers (h, k), where h is the height of the person 
// and k is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to h.

// Sort the vector with the first row bigger and the second row smaller, and insert
// one by one, it can make sure that all bigger value has set in the vector
