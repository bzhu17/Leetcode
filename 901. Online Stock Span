//Description: give an array and find the previous number which is less than or equal 
// [100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85]->[1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6]

// At first I think to compare the current number with previous number with a vector 
// contains the number that previous number less than or equal, and than compare again

// But we can use a stack, which contain a pair, and the current number compared to the 
// top of the stack, the stack contains the quantity of the diffrent number, use a loop
// to compare untill the one bigger than the current number
